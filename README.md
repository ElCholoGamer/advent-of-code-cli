# Advent of Code CLI &middot; ![Build](https://github.com/ElCholoGamer/advent-of-code-cli/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

A decently command-line interface I made because I was bored.

(Don't use this too frecuently, the AoC servers can only handle so much requests, so this CLI may cause problems if used too frecuently)

## Installation

This CLI requires node version 8.x.x or greater.

You can install this using [npm][npm] or [yarn][yarn]:

```
$ npm i -g advent-of-code-cli
$ yarn global add advent-of-code-cli
```

## Usage

To run the CLI, run the following command:

```
$ aoc
```

A menu should pop up, where you must enter your session cookie to send with requests.

(If you don't have a session cookie, you can grab it on the "Application" tab of mostly any browser's DevTools, stored as "session" in the site cookies)
